I feel like we covered this well in person yesterday, so I'll keep my comments here brief: I recommend jettisoning the web scraping and just manually put in the data (while documenting where it comes from) in order to speed the project along. Work on making that output as robust as possible and as close as possible to your vision of the project without following all the way through on it. Keep up the good comments as well!
