# Comments
Good line-by-line comments throughout the code.

# Code Quality
You managed to get the schedule API up and running, which was great. The two quote functions that you wrote could have been accomplished by just using the print command. I would also have liked a little more context when running your code: it wasn't clear to me that it was actually running once I started it because it takes a while for the first message to print. If you were writing messages in the code manually, it also would have been good to see more of them than just two.

# Ambition
I admire the ambition of the overall project and what it could be given enough time. Your README was generally good, but I would have liked to see a bit more about what you might envision the unfinished pieces of this project to be.
